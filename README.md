# gameOfLife
Conway's Game of Life in C++

Rules of the game
1. If fewer than 2 neighbors, then the cell dies
2. If 2 or 3 live neighbors, then cell survives to next generation.
3. If more than 3 neighbors, the cell dies.
4. If dead cell has exactly 3 neighbors, then born/revived.

This is just a side project to practice coding.
